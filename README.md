# CrowdFundWithNewERC20Token

This crowdfunding project was made for Akbank web3 practicum homework. 
In this app, It can be created a new ERC20 token, and arrange features like total supply, mint, burn etc. Then It could be pledged token to apply a campaign also unpledged, cancel, claim etc..  
In this repository, there are two files. One is for deploying a new ERC20 token contract and the other is for the crowdfunding app.

Here are the contracts that I deployed to Rinkeby testnet
The token contract: 0x13f7df0b13233b6d56c97ea0d0a87f90566d2d57
The crowdfunding contract: 0x4A4D07f5709e3FE0CB2312294f40Ff40e46b0dBf
